    "text": "KS McKinsey Quantum Black Notes Jim Boehm, WEMBA37 - Buy a cat - Be nice to people - Chief security officer - Ex military CÃ©cile Prinsen, Associate Partner - Intro Jared Moon, Senior Partner, Digital & AI Leader - What is Quantum Black - Digital analytics - AI, data analysis, technology - Grown 10x in his time in the firm - Have acquired and partnered with other firms - QuantumBlack founded by 3 guys in formula 1 racing - Improving performance of high performance teams (Formula 1) - 1.5k people across 40 offices and work across industry to help high performing teams - QuantumBlack Labs builds open source toolkits to build AI across industries - Continued sports heritage with emerites sailing racing team - How do we unlock impact with AI - McKinsey has had QuantumBlack in the portfolio in 10 years but has really taken off in the last few years - Most companies are not really getting value even if they are using AI - Several shifts: individual use cases to transitioning a domain, LLM for individual task to using a group of agentic AI working for you as a team - Software engineering, create a team of agents to do each agile role - planning, requirements writing and decomposition, development, QA, etc. - Agentic AI will change the way firms compete, speed to produce will be a key value driver - What should I have my children study? Mix of skills and mix of work will evolve, a lot of the craftsmanship and unique things people do has changed and evolved - Internal tool called Lily that replaces associates - all the things that bring you up the learning curve, things that used to take weeks - Generative AI will change the way business gets done and how clients and businesses interact - Agentic KYC (Know Your Client), squads of agents that work together, and in each squad there is a planner, analyzer, critic, working together to create managed quality outputs - 5 Key Challenges: 1) Limited scaling beyond pilots, 2) Lack of end-to-end impact, 3) Show shift to production, 4) Fragmented tech usage, 5) Insufficient Change Management - What do leading organizations do? Create a treasure map of opportunities to align the organization, creating platform to be able to do this and scale, build the technical and change management capabilities, empower the workforce, demonstrate transformative impact early - Not about LLM, have created a platform to build agents, write goals, plan the work, and execute - Deploying agents at scale makes you almost model agnostic - The attention processes slow for modular agent improvements, what's can your experience updating your agents? - Jared: Not there yet where model learns over time, positive reinforcement where in software the results of unit and component testing is fed bank into critic agents but still not perfect, but it will come - Concept of analyst and associates starting with the firm, how do you think about that in the context of hiring and mentoring new people and having them learn the trade so they can become senior partners? - Jared: particularly relevant in stuff development, in consulting doing the research into company, research, and competitors is how many people really learn, a lot of entry with can be bypassed now, making sure AI is one tool of many that people use and we run AB tests and have metrics on people's output to see what the outcomes and quality of the work, a lot of companies can't do this, so we need to continue to work through how to train and mentor and develop entry level processes - For companies who use generative and agentic AI where they aren't seeing ROI how do you help them know what use cases drive value - Jared: domain is kind of irrelevant, you put the organization and change management around it, that's where they value is, whole book about how you deliver transformational change open by partners at the firm - Since this is a newer change what have you seen work well? How do you organize teams of agents - Jared: nothing is different about change management, at the end of the day it's the same things that need to charge, influence, role modeling, hard and soft influence, etc., you almost have to rewrite the org charts, almost like a SME who manages 5-15 agents, in the form org charts they have physical and virtual team members Emily Sagar-Jones, Principal Data Scientist David, Engineer - KYC how we have agentified and a adverse media implementation - Quite complex highly manual processes - First step is to map out the process because those steps are what translates into an agentic approach - Individual teams of agents that work together to complete smaller tasks,",

What is critical for them? How does this change their job? - They create a report, the agents pull this information and insight relevance and source for each issue - Very low code/ no code, user has to be able to define the statement of work, it's but a prompt it's a job description, making them transferrable across projects - Is there a way to provide prompts? - Emily: more about tackling large prompts so it's less about a prompt and more about a goal, and creating agents with the right persona to achieve the goal, the prompt engineering will go into the goal - How does this change your relationship with your clients? Building something that stays with them in perpetuity? - Emily: hasn't changed a huge amount, used to build models for companies, built this platform to allow us to address these use cases, however if they do use our platform we build it out in their environment to demonstrate an impact and then go into pilot scaling phases and sit with their people to build and maintain and they start managing it, less like a software company where they are selling the platform, they are building it with them instead - Have you seen multi agent success in creative use cases? - Emily: it's been a mix, staying to use this in the marketing world, can work well, when it comes with imagery and videos still very early days, will see more in the future - There's is no AI later which can connect to other systems? - Emily: we've just built this, called Arc, AI mesh to use agents from different places from a central place, across different platforms and this will be very important for clients, we are starting to bring this to clients - How are you designing guidelines arrive risk and data? - David: This Arc later, how we manage and monitor different pieces and layers across an entire organization, need to be careful you don't join up an unknown input into controlling you databases or access data you don't want exposed, big security focus from clients, still being sorted at industry level - Can agents spot check? - David: very large number of processes at once which lends itself to LLM monitoring - Can you backtrack through the decision tree? - Emily: logs are generated but also a way of accessing from a more central area, what agents are used, what tools are used, the conversation, important to enable monitoring and also checking for drift as new models come out to make sure the performance is good as models evolve - Does it work with a more complex workflow? - Emily: working with a bank a few weeks ago with many squads working together, you need that orchestration layer - How do you address confidentiality for clients? - Emily: once you start using LLMs need to do anonymization step, when we do this for clients we bring everything within their own cloud environment so it's all under their control - David takes over and starts talking about another use case - Bank core systems are running on legacy code and infrastructure which is difficult to use and maintain - Massive cost element that they foresee only increasing - Cutting the costs down means moving the legacy code into modern code, may have 10 year plans - Even the project to reduce costs is a huge cost - We can bring agents in and reduce 10",

Are the agents doing this? - David: you have to test in the infrastructure you want to run on, try as much to bring in CI/CD of the client in to the approach, there's still a strong desire to have human review before willing to take code into production want to get to the lung where agentic system makes a PR that can be reviewed just like humans do, LLMs can help with code quality, have SMEs codify standards - How do you interact with client software QA? - David: right now clients want to review everything and it's primarily SMEs, can we get to a point where more junior colleagues can so these reviews and spread out the work - Thousands of data attributes in the legacy system, how do you ensure you don't lose that? - David: do analysis of existing days structures and determining what that should look like in a new database, holistic approach needed - Do you have use cases with large enterprise systems? - David: I think we are but I would have to refer you to my other colleagues - What models are you using and how do they compare and work together? - David: mostly using commercial models, what we often need to do is build in evaluations over sections of the pipeline and we need to monitor to ensure it stays where it needs to be, as systems get better we may not need so baby small steps Jim Boehm, Partner in Risk & Resilience - Why you get tacit or lack of participation from companies is risk - Should McKinsey partner with or compete with Palantir - Joined Navy at 18 right before 9/11 - Got out and went to Goldman, then to JP Morgan, then intelligence community, then McKinsey - A couple of kids, wife is physician but pivoting to architecture, kids in school - WEMBA was a formative experience - Statistics class, probably Waterman, pulled him aside and said quit asking me for more information, you won't be the person I give my model to, but you will be the person who takes the model and leads a large group through it - You should be spending your time with your colleagues at WEMBA - Good at identifying people's strengths - The Best strategic decision you can make is to get into the floor of whatever is the biggest baddest and fastest growing things - It's",

I need prime to start thinking about how to solve a clients problem that we can give them and if not is there something we can build, if not that then can we bring in something external, three least resort is a person, going to become much more about building and managing that's what we need humans to do - You said you wouldn't change anything about your WEMBA experience, is there anything you would recommend that we do with 9 months left? - Jim: be radically honest with those around you about your career aspirations, after WEMBA almost a third of his class got divorced, you operate in a different space in WEMBA and afterwards no over cares about that, be really honest about what you want to do and what you're goals are - What gets you going in consulting? - Jim: spite, being told I can't do something, timelines are shorter and stakes were much higher - How do you make sure the human element and empathy remains in the system? - Jim: the long arc of history trends towards good, I believe this, learning how to leverage those capabilities to unlock our team members to do what they want to do or can do, what is the human equivalent of writing a unit test, it's one thing to get people in the room it's another to get them in a room and give hard feedback or ask hard questions, AI isn't going to fundamentally change how we are as people, the ruthless efficiency we want to bend this towards unlocks our teams to be closer to humanity Helen MÃ¶llering, Project Lead from Munich - Changing what we have to control and think about risk with the move to Agentic - How do we make sure there's no leak of information or privilege escalation - Moving towards governance - Where do you see the responsibility within a company? - Helen: have not seen a company fully rolled out or with Agentic AI, need to adjust at the quality level, ultimately people must always be involved - Each silo tends to have it's own engineering requirements and methods, have you seen cases where organizations break down those silos - Helen: more mature companies try to consolidate their functions for risk and cyber, I see this as the future - How do you balance risk and innovation? - Helen: if you're too focused on risk you don't do anything, open support for the changes and showing the changes, showcasing how we can control these risks, roles and responsibilities are changing but it doesn't change needing to have a human in the loop - CÃ©cil: I am getting questions sure day to day from technology teams about how to do it right, these teams are being proactive and taking control of it, turn risk into requirement and proceed accordingly - How do you put a number on risk management? - CÃ©cil: looking at it as an upside story not just a downside - Heavily regulated in bias and cyber - Reputational and business risks from agentic AI misalignment because you either didn't give the agent the right task or they didn't have enough information - Agentic AI introduces new risks: cross agent task escalation, untraceable data leakage, synthetic identity risk, chained vulnerabilities, days corruption propagation - Do you talk to clients about risk separately or as part of a larger discussion - Helen: always both ways - The agents are still based from the same LLM so the same level of governance, is it possible they are",

Use case based? - Zachary: there is no AI strategy without a data strategy, in the last 12 months shifted to adopt a data mesh concept going system by system to put data in AWS and working with Accenture and AWS, what got the board excited was that they needed this for AI, spending more on their data work than AI work at this time, deep partnership with AWS has been key to unlocking potential in data and AI, if you just deliver value you never finish, you need a roadmap - Graham: Use cases, here are the things you can do and here's what you need, but you have to have a hook - How do you develop a culture around AI and taking this risk? - Graham: Bank has been on a drive to help people think more innovatively and to be agile, boil it down to letting employees experiment and fail without affecting their bonuses, bottom up, push tons of training and opportunities as they go, don't make guidelines too strict to allow and encourage people to take risks, communications to staff phrases the AI rollout as an experiment, include your team members and get them engaged - In a zero fail environment, what is the next big thing? - Graham: Completely independent research team working on imagining a future that aren't yet possible, RE: zero fail we never tell the business we can be a hundred percent right, match the underlying telemetry, is it as good as people are? - Zachary: Is surgery or anyone really zero fail? Yes that is the goal, similarly the leaders are still personally liable Alexandros Anatolakis, Data Scientist - Talking about customer complaints and AI - Increasing quality, throughout - Number of complaints is labor intensive, 3000 complaints per week and 80% require a final response to the customer - Why not just use ChatGPT?

The letters must comply with very strict regulations, outcomes may be tricky which is why a generic solution would not work - Solution has been live since 2024, making continuous improvements - information is put in 3rd party tool and then the 3-part custom tool for writing the complaint letter is employed - Using more automation in evaluating letter quality, auto-eval - Asked broad range of employees to do blind scoring of human and AI letters, AI was snoring higher - Key Learnings: Overcoming skepticism, Compliance alignment, Quality assurance, Collaborative development, Generating momentum - Are you paying companies like Open AI or other smaller projects or largely partnering with large projects? - Graham: total costs to gpt 4.0 calls is less than $4k - Zachary: really positive ROIs on the project, used accenture for that, building their own tools, scale is the hard part not enough people with the data science skills - Did you really create a model or is it prompt engineering? - Alexandros: we did prompt engineering, we want to give this a better voice, use gpt 4.0 after doing model comparison - Zachary: evaluate everything, we are model agnostic - Did the automated complaint prices drive changes in behavior for how complaint investigations were performed or documented? - Alexandros: We did not change the current process, convincing people was hard - Zachary: Drove enforcement and use of the current process - Graham: The process transformation is just as important as the tools, right now we are just optimizng the current processes not complete transformation which is the next step, helping the investigators with the complaint investigators, eventually predicting complaints Mihir Tare, Data Scientist - Focus on transaction data, but maybe underutilizing data because we don't have tools or it is hard to understand - Why networks, there is information within the relationships of the data that we were missing - Created groupings of account types to build a transaction network - 3-stage inductive algorithm used to create 'transaction neighborhoods' - Easier data to consume and understand with the graphical embeddings - Need to show things are valuable and that they work and are worth the work - How can we quantify how people send money to each other? - Visualizing the embeddings, reducing dimensions from many to 2, visual validation - Making inferences, such as user physical locations from the transactions, picking up on traits from accounts that are not provided explicitly - Applied to a real world problem, predict money laundering, identifying these accounts, fraud detection, they saw an improvement in the metrics at the top level with high confidence - Do you have structured data that you can query an LLM? If you add a new database will the network automatically update? - Mihir: knowledge graphs is something that has been explored but not something we do, model is written for the data they have, would have to be expanded - Zachary: This is being done in memory, traditional data science but unique in it's scale, everyone is thinking about generative AI but traditional data science is still very important, graphs also useful for AI Giulio Pelosio, Data Scientist - Recently published paper for a finance conference in Singapore - Very important that this is reliable and able to identify biases - Regulations have been slow but picking up - Proxy bias - feature into a label - Swapping names with nationalities in the date set - Smaller models tend to be more biased - Have you compared this to human biases? - Zachary: right question to ask, for us this means blinding names from analysis, we are all biased and we need to come up with some kind of correction Davesh Batra, Data Scientist - How we are using LLMs for fraud reporting chat - The number of frauds are huge and we want to scale the ability to have an LLM agent chat with the customer and identify their issue - Take notes from customer, classify, and then investigate and recommend an action - How do we validate a chatbot? - Low cost stress testing at scale, edge cases they otherwise would not have covered - AI struggled with empathy, but there was a bias of the SMEs against LLM - Too many thank you's - Currently in early validation phase:",

No â this is a Cap Ex boom, look at investment relative to EDF - Al from experiment â operating system - Q: why use tokens to measure AI usage A: No good way, self report is great, cost of tokens dropping, tokens scale w/ complexity of use - Q: Do you have use case figures for global data? A: There aren't really good data, rely on data from companies like McKinseyKing's College, meeting with PEELER THE SEEEFEALAI Experts Brent Hoberman, Founder of First minute - Barriers to entry for competitors now is different, capital was a barrier to entry, new barriers: - Brand - Pace - Data - Network Effects - Having the world's Best People - Al is everything everywhere all at once, change of pace is high, no consensus on future - Don't battle on creating foundation model, focus on application layer & \"unsexy things\" , biz-dev platforms - Agriculture supply chain - Buying/selling a house - customer acquisition as biz-dev deals - corporate venture capital is less successful in the UK, ex. ASML recent invention, encardo (?), wave - London is still the best place in the UK but still challenges - France is promoting entrepreneurship - Silicon Valley has work ethic but its a monoculture, London sometimes wins b/c its a polyculture, cultural differences - stress can kill you though - why aren't people starting more companies? so easy, Al gets you 90%, last 10% is hard - Low code workflow automation, this is the right pool to be fishing in - Q: what are the characteristics that make London good for startups A: Large corporate presence, adverts & fintech, talent, customers, visas could be better, multiculturalism - Q: Vc screening in London? A: you get super bright people in VC, often odd/contrarian/different, contrarian & right, what are the credibility markers, problem w/ Al is great presentation but you need to know something as well - Q: Credibility markers, how to rank for startup investments? A: Team-what is it about theme, Total Addressable Market (TAM), venture â what if everything goes right? Make the VC fear what they will miss, use of funds, get 2 years, demonstrate what you'll do and how you will spend it - Q: What does retaining top talent look like? A: Dubai-based Russians built a brilliant Al business if your team is that good why would you stay? Human element, built together, equity will be worth enough. Want interesting work, purpose driven company, leaders in field. Profit & Purpose is best - Q: How do you choose your VC? A: Assuming you think this is worth it. Who will be your partner? connect to other entrepreneurs they have previously backed both the successful & failed, VC's will want you to take even more extreme risks, help with recruitment, biz-dev, fund raising - Q: How do you compete w/ other VC's in funding rounds?

A: stunned if His. grad in 2035 would be expected to use Al to improve intellectual tasks, easier to ruin critical thinking w/the tool so hard to thread the needle",
